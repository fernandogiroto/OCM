# OCM - Full Stack Technical Challenge

This repository contains the solution for a full-stack technical challenge, which consists of:

1. Fetching data from a public API  
2. Storing this data in a database  
3. Creating a web interface to display the data  
4. Implementing a dynamic search to filter the data

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### Backend (Laravel)

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```
2. Install PHP dependencies with Composer:
```bash
composer install
```
3. Create a MySQL database for the project.
4. Configure your .env file (copy .env.example if needed) and set your database credentials:
```bash
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```
5. Run migrations to create the database tables:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
6. Seed the database with initial data fetched from the external API:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
7. Start the Laravel development server:
```bash
php artisan db:serve
```
The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8000 (or another port if specified).
Note: If the URL provided by php artisan serve is different from http://localhost:8000,
make sure to update the backend API URL in your frontend .env file accordingly (e.g., VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:PORT/api).

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### Frontend (Vue.JS)

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend
```
2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The frontend app will be available at http://localhost:5173/ (or the URL shown in your terminal).
